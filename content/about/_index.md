I'm a software developer with a passion for backend engineering and automation. I'm currently working at GitLab as a Support Engineer. I've worked in several roles ranging from front-line support to infrastructure engineering. I'm a husband and father to a son (soon two), who loves to spend time with family, experiment with different tech, and hike.
