### My blog's Repo

Build badge, why not: [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7cc392da-a178-4d83-9705-2d3d6d4f5e8b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/dcoy-blog/deploys)

This is the repo to store my blog: [https://david-coy.com](https://david-coy.com).

The blog itself is hosted in an AWS S3 bucket, served by CloudFront. I use [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org) to perform the "build" process using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

More to come...
